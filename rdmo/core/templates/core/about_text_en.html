        The Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO) enables institutions as well as researchers to plan and carry out their management of research data. RDMO can assemble all relevant planning information and data management tasks across the whole life cycle of the research data.
        The RDMO tool was developed by the project partners of Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam, University of Applied Sciences of Potsdam and the library of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and is mantained by the RDMO consortium.
